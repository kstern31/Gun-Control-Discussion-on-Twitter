# Gun-Control-Discussion-on-Twitter

1. Use GetOldTweets to collect tweets regarding gun control from Twitter. I limited the search to select hashtags, as the 
search query of "guns" or "gun control" led to many irrelevant results. I also only collected tweets with at least 1
favorite or retweet, so that I knew the tweet impacted someone other than the person who wrote it. I searched tweets the day
of, and the 6 days after the past 8 mass shooting events in the US, in the hopes of getting tweets that were most pertinent
to the gun control discussion

2. Stored tweets in mongoDB.

3. Data cleaning and NLP analysis done in dataAnalysis notebook.

4. clusterviz_final.html has a TSNE plot that shows the 4 topics from the TF-IDF analysis.
